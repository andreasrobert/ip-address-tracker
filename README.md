# IP address tracker, Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This app uses [IP Geolocation API](https://geo.ipify.org/) to get the ip address locations, and to generate the map I used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).
For starters try 8.8.8.8! [ip-address-tracker23.netlify.app](https://ip-address-tracker23.netlify.app/)
